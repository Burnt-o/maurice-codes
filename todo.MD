**Todo:**


Performance:
 * replace hero title with sprite for performance ? and use a mask on the glass (edited)

 * replace background images with smaller file size jpgs

 * It's probably the scroll observer (and hero-title-glass animating on it) killing my low-spec performance.
Make the scroll observer addListen/remove listen based on animation toggle

Responsive layout aka mobile design

Minimalist design pass (on hero image and main background image)

Remove the animated bg lights from hero image and instead make the halo ring do that right-to-left effect
