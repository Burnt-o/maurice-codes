I'm known online as *Burnt*. For the last decade I’ve been developing solid foundational software engineering skills via open-source projects with a focus on C++, C#, reverse engineering, desktop application development and whole-project architecture, collaborating with highly active user communities to create user-friendly GUI’s, to manage and investigate issues, and to deliver exciting features and functionality. 
I’m fascinated not by any particular language or framework, but of developing a philosophy around good, maintainable and readable code. Self-documenting, test-driven, modular and reusable, clear in intent, and specific about object ownership, dependencies and lifetime. Let’s talk pee pee poo poo.
