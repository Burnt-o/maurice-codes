The CE enemy randomiser is a “for fun” mod of the game Halo CE that directly hooks game code to modify how and when enemy characters spawn, “randomising” them according to a set of user-created rules. Users configure rules via a 2D immediate-mode GUI displayed within the games own rendering pipeline via a DirectX12::Present hook. The mod also allows randomisation of game textures, sounds, and music.
