HCM started life as a save-state management tool for games in the Halo series, providing users a way to backup, inject and manage save-states in a personal database. In collaboration with the robust speedrunning community, HCM is now a fully-featured practice tool, DLL injecting into a games process to hook graphics API calls to create an internal overlay & GUI, and providing customisable functionality ranging from invulnerability, AI manipulation, game object information overlays, process speed manipulation, 3D camera control and more.  
Core functionality is implemented in modern C++ utilizing best practices such as RAII, pimpl idiom, meta-programming (templates, variadic macros) and dependency injection. Extensive reverse-engineering skill of x64 assembly was developed, as was project architecture/design (achieving separation of concerns on both the macro and micro scale). Windows and DirectX APIâ€™s were extensively used and manipulated with function detours/hooks and direct assembly patching.
